# SPACE STAGRAM

This is an application showing images of space by using nasa's api.

## What I will do

● Display five randomly selected images on the initial screen  
● Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page  
● Animate the “like” action (a heart?)  
● Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data  
● Create shareable links for each image  
● Add a start date-picker and an end date-picker to be able to browse photos between 2 dates.

`mkdir space_stagram`
`cd space_stagram`
`npx create-react-app .`
`npm run start`

Now, we can see the react webpage with the website address 'localhost:3000'. Let's elaborate each file in src folder.

- App.css : css file for style
- App.js : js file for making logic
- App.test.js : js file to test functionality or css, etc.
- index.css : probably I will not use this file
- logo.svg : I will not use this file
- reportWebVitals.js : a tool to check the efficiency of react
- setupTests.js : a file to use React testing library

I deleted logo.svg file and reportWebVitals.js file.
